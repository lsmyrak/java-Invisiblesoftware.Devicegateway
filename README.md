# DeviceGateway

Project created as part of a **challenge to learn Java and Spring Boot from scratch**.  
The goal of this project is to build a practical solution that connects IoT devices with client applications in a unified way.

**DeviceGateway** is a lightweight gateway that acts as a **proxy** between IoT devices and clients, supporting both **MQTT** and **HTTP** protocols.  
It is implemented in **Java (Spring Boot)** to ensure scalability, flexibility, and easy integration with modern smart home or industrial IoT systems.

Main objectives:
- Learn the fundamentals of **Java** and the **Spring Boot** framework by building a real-world project.  
- Provide a **communication bridge** between devices (e.g., ESPHome-based nodes) and client applications.  
- Enable **bidirectional communication** via MQTT and HTTP.
